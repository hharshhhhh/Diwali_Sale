# SuperStore Data Dashboard
In this dashboard, I've utilized a dataset from a United States superstore.
The visualizations showcase the sales of the store categorized by both category and sub-category, as well as the monthly sales and profits over two years. 
Additionally, the dashboard features a summary of sales totals across different segments.
